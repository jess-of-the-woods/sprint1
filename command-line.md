The Command line is a way to control your computer by using text commands. Its quite different from using a graphical user interface but its quite easy once you get the hang of it. You can do things like opening files, changing your location to another directory, copying a file form one place to another etc. 

Some examples of terminal commands:
1. ls - lists all documents (and subfolders) in current directory.
2. pwd - tells you where you are located (what directory you are in)
3. cp filename /home/user - copies a file to another directory /home/user/
4. hostname - tells you the name of the computer you are using
5. mkdir directoryname - creates a new directory with the name you specify
6. cd / - changes directory in to the root directory
7. touch filename - creates  a new file with the name you specify
8. mv filename /home/user/workspace - moves a file to the destination directory /home/user/workspace
9. passwd - allows you to set a new password for your system
10. rm filename - deletes a file
